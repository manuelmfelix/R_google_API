# R_google_API

Using R with google places and google maps API

The code found on the file "googleMaps_Screenshot_ShinyApp" shows a Shiny App that interacts with the googlemaps api to get periodic screenshots of the chosen places with the chosen zooms. In the app you can choose the days of the week to run the app, the time frame to run the app, the last day to run the app and there is the possibility to choose a more frequent period for the screenshots.

The code found on the file "google_places_shiny" was developed to get information from the Google Places API using a shiny interface.
